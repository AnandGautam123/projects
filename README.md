# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will also see any lint errors in the console.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more information.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed! Refer to the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section for more information.
- `npm run eject`: **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!** If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project. At this point, you will have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. You don't have to ever use `eject`, but it's available if you need it.
